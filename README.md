Fixed up by **apekros** for Python3 and Plugin Manager 2.0

binja_sigmaker plugin for Binary Ninja

## Description:

Generate Signatures to use for pattern scanning in other applications.

- The signature has the same form like the sequence of bytes in IDA (eg. 89 45 FC FF 15 ? ? ? ?)
- You can create a signature at any point inside a function.  
- If there is no unique signature at that position, the plugin will create a signature for the beginning of the function.
